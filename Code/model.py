# MODEL (imagine main)
# Only cares about tasks; doesn't ask for input

Different files have different functions:
model.py - organizes everything and runs tasks
view.py - displays what user sees
controller.py - controls user input and connects model and view
game_setup.py - creates the game board and all pre-game setup
